title: About me
info1: >-
  I am Kirill Timchenko, born in Russia, Birobidzhan.
  My path of becoming as a developer started in 2017.
  In summer holidays i learned html/css/javascript and made some web pages for fun but felt like i needed to dive deeper.
  Since that i started learning how a computer works under the hood, what linux kernel, c/c++ is.
  Also i had a great CS teacher in school who taught me a lot about algorithms.
  Theory is good but i realised that i should make a real software.
  I wanted to write an application that receives a text and then speaks it into a microphone.
  Since at that moment i was mainly using python, i decided to write the application using pyside5.
  After completing the project i started to study C++ and Qt5 more deeply.
  During learning i have made a cross platform mp3 player for my mother
  (of course it was not really great at all but it was literally my first big project) and a desktop application
  that solves some exam problems at the request of my teacher. Between writing these projects i found a great C++ library
  called SFML and thought why not to make a terraria clone.
  I have implemented procedure world generation, breaking/placing blocks, UI, inventory/chunk system,
  animations, world serialization. At the moment i dropped this project but maybe i'll continue working on it.

  Once i needed to write a backend service for my application, i had a litle bit of
  experience with flask/django but i didn't like dynamically-typed languages
  for big projects, so i instantly dropped python. I had no desire to
  learn C# or Java but found Go and really liked it at first sight. Even now i really
  like this language since it is simple and solves all problems related to
  backend development.

  Now i am focusing on web development, more on backend than frontend.

  I have experience in writing scripts in python and bash.
  To make it easier to analyze applicant lists i made a python script that prints
  a list of all applicants or statistics that show current applicant position. Source code is
